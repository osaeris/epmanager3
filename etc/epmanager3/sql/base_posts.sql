There is no need to use anything other than your web browser (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari) to make your ePortfolio. There is a facility to paste from word-processor shown as a <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.dgmyspace.dumgal.ac.uk/eportfolios/testportfolio/wp-content/plugins/nds-paste/paste/images/pasteword.gif\" /> when writing a post. If you have some information in a document you wish to transfer into your portfolio but this should be fairly rare.\r\n\r\nDon\'t upload word-processor documents as blog entries. This defeats the purpose of having editing facilities on your portfolio. The search function will not find any text contained in a document either. Also, consider that an employer may not be using the same type of word-processor that you are! Type directly into your web page.\r\n\r\n<strong>Here are some recommended file types for working on your ePortfolio:\r\n</strong>To show <strong>photos</strong> in your ePortfolio use either <a title=\"jpeg on wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg\">JPEG</a> (typically created by digital cameras) or <a title=\"png files on wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics\">PNG</a> files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)\r\n\r\nIf you have photos to put on your ePortfolio (from a digital camera) they need to be resized before use.  If you need to resize your images, try the <a title=\"image resizer\" href=\"http://www.dglearnnet.com/moodle2/apps/imageresizer/imageresizer.php\">automatic ePortfolio image resizer</a> on LearnNet.\r\n\r\nFor <strong>sounds</strong> use <a title=\"mp3 at wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3\">mp3</a> files (.mp3).\r\nFor <strong>video</strong> use <strong>mp4</strong> video which is probably already produced by your smartphone or tablet. We have a video converter in College to create flash video from other formats which will also work in your ePortfolio (but may not work for <i>all</i> of your site visitors). Ask your tutor about this if you are having problems with video on your ePortfolio.\r\n\r\n<strong>Never use:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a title=\"MS Paint on WikiPedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint\">MS Paint</a> (.bmp) - These images are much too large</li>\r\n	<li><a title=\"wav files on wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav\">WAV Files</a> (.wav) - These sound files are often 10 times larger than mp3 files</li>\r\n	<li><a title=\"avi files on wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVI\">AVI Files</a> (.avi) - AVI files are too unpredictable to use in your website</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>PS: You can safely delete this post!</strong>\r\n\r\n</div>','dos and donts','','publish','open','open','','dos-and-donts','','','2014-01-23 10:55:09','2014-01-23 10:55:09','',0,'http://interneteproot/joebloggs/?page_id=8',0,'page','',0),(10,1,'2014-01-15 13:00:22','2014-01-15 13:00:22','<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>\r\nPut your personal details on the password protected personal details page, not in this public page.\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Desired employment / Occupational field</strong></td>\r\n<td>(remove if not relevant)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Work experience</strong></td>\r\n<td>Add separate entries for each relevant post occupied, starting from the most recent.Dates\r\nOccupation or position held\r\nMain activities and responsibilities\r\nName and address of employer\r\nType of business or sector\r\n\r\n(remove if not relevant)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Education and training</strong></td>\r\n<td>Add separate entries for each relevant course you have completed, starting from the most recent.Dates\r\nTitle of qualification awarded\r\nPrincipal subjects/occupational skills covered\r\nName and type of organisation providing education and training\r\nLevel in national or international classification\r\n\r\n(remove if not relevant)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Personal skills and competences</strong></td>\r\n<td>Replace this text by a description of these competences and indicate where they were acquired.
