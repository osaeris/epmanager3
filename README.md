About EPManager
-----------------
EPManager is a system which allows ePortfolios to be created for individuals. The ePortfolio design was derived from the <a href='http://isle.paisley.ac.uk/default.aspx'>ISLE project</a>. An ePortfolio in the context of EPManager is fundamentally a Wordpress blog with default post categories and pages to be filled in by the learner as they progress. Completing the pages included by default was a requirement for students taking part in the <acronym title="Individualised Support for Learning through ePortfolios">ISLE</acronym> project, but of course you can decide for yourself whether the pages and categories are relevant to your own situation.

There are two types of user in an ePortfolio called student and lecturer. The student is the owner of the ePortfolio, whereas the lecturer is a low privilege user, ony able to write posts and comment on the students progress. An ePortfolio can have several lecturers (in case a student is using their ePortfolio in several different classes). A student can decide to share a post with eveyone, just with their lecturers or with no-one at all using the User Access Manager plugin.  The student can effectively keep a private record/diary of their reflections, sharing only the pieces of information they wish to share.

Persistence
-----------
One of the concerns at the beginning of the ISLE project was persistence of the student data. EPManager allows a student ePortfolio to be backed up to a static website (say for presenting on a USB key)

Single Sign On
--------------
Developers should refer to the contents of wp-content/plug3-singlesignonlink.php in an eportfolio to set up single sign on.
